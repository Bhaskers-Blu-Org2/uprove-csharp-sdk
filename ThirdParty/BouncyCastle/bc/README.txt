Recommended parameters and test vectors used by the U-Prove SDK can be re-generated 
for validation purposes by loading and running the UProveParams and UProveTestVectors
projects, respectively. The projects depend on the full BouncyCastle library: it must 
be obtained from http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/, the compiled DLL must be placed
in this directory, and the two projects must be added to the solution before compiling it.
